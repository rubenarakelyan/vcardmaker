# vCardMaker

vCardMaker is a split frontend/backend application with PHP and C# backends for creating version 2.1 and 3.0 vCards.

The C# version can be used both with Windows/IIS and Linux running Mono. The PHP version also includes a frontend.

The `_zip` folder contains original zipped source code for all versions of the application.

## Setup

As well as customising any strings, remember to include a valid email address at the bottom of your chosen script (vCardMaker.php or vCardMaker.cs) where denoted. This email address will appear as the "from" address in any emails sent by the backend scripts.
